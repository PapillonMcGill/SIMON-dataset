# SIMON Dataset
	
### Overview

The Single Individual volunteer for Multiple Observations across Networks (SIMON) MRI dataset is a sample of convenience of one healthy male aged between 29 and 46 years old, scanned in 73 sessions at multiple sites and with various scanner models. Each of these sessions includes at least an anatomical T1-weighted image, in addition to other modalities (T1, T2- and PD-weighted, T2-star, diffusion, resting state fMRI, susceptibility, arterial spin labelling), which vary from one session to another (refer to the publications for the design detail). These images were partly acquired through the implementation of the [Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (CDIP)](www.cdip-pcid.ca), which is still ongoing. Thus, more images will be acquired in the future and added to the dataset.
